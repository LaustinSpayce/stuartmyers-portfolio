## Portfolio website for Stuart Myers

This is the source code for my portfolio website.

Using Gatsby as the site doesn't require server-side rendering, so a static site generator saves on hosting costs.

Also migrated away from using Wordpress.com as the back-end CMS as it's expensive (using just markdown is free) and I can keep the content and the layout together in one place.

Having my website content as markdown also means if I migrate elsewhere it is easy to export/import anywhere else.
