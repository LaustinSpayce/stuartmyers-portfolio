The ST-808 is a web-based retro drum machine, loosely inspired by classic drum machines and technologies such as the Roland TR-808, TR-909 and Akai MPC-3000.

All of the sounds are generated within the browser using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) which means that you can change things like the amount decay on the slap or snare sounds for instance.

The hi-hats also share an instrument, so a closed hat sound will 'choke' an open hat sound.

The main design of the website is done using [react.js](https://reactjs.org/), with [material ui](https://material-ui.com/) for the styling.
