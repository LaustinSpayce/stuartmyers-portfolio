Over the last few months I've been learning how to code and also learning how to incorporate sound effects with audio middleware. This all culminated in a simple game that's got the rather goofy title "Boaty McBoatface Island Adventure".

Art Assets are from [Kenney.nl](http://kenney.nl) or free from the Unity Asset Store. Audio middle-ware engine is [FMOD.](https://www.fmod.com/)

Essentially how it started was through learning Unity, I decided to one day "fly solo" without just blindly following tutorials all the time. This then gave birth to a very simple game with a very simple square boat on a very simple plane, with a very simple Island. I ended up making the little boat that could:

Later that day I managed to get the boat behaving correctly, staying in the water as opposed to climbing onto land! This was August 18th 2017 when I first started on the game.

A week later I had managed to incorporate a shooting mechanic, the boat can sail and fire cannonballs out the sides.

By the end of august it was getting to quite a playable state, with basic sound effects and everything! I had started getting some external assets in to help with art. I'm very pleased with the overall look with assets from [Kenney.](http://kenney.nl)

After this I worked on the game much more, basically treating it as a full-time job over the next couple weeks as opposed to just working an hour or so when I felt like it. Many more features were added, including NPC enemy boats, a jet spray that launches the boat into the air. Plus original music, I even spent a day down East Coast Park in Singapore getting Beach sounds (and hoping not too much motorboat/motorway noise ended up in the final game!)

As this project is mostly for learning how to create a game from scratch. The entire Unity project with all files are [available on Github.](https://github.com/LaustinSpayce/Sailing-Ship)

Further along, the game starts taking shape, with island and targets. The full sound design and music is last to come, I guess you will have to download and play from [itch.io?](https://laustinspayce.itch.io/boaty-mcboatface-island-adventure)

Alternatively,  I've found a surprising number of Let's Plays for this game, I'm hugely proud that this game is out and people are enjoying it.

As a cheeky reward for reading this far, here are some of the funny glitches I had while making the game:
