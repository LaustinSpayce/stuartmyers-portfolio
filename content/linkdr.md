[Linkdr is where people hire software developers.](http://linkdr.herokuapp.com/) Like in real life, but better.

Working as a team with 3 other students at General Assembly, we developed Linkdr within one week.

My efforts were largely focussed in managing Candidate and Company matches, with lots of Rails Active Record Queries and data wrangling to present to the front end.
