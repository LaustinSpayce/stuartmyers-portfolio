> The second installment of Mata Mata focuses on post-independent Singapore in the late 60s to 70s â€” a time when Singapore underwent great transformation as a new nation. Seen through the eyes of young women police officers, the series continues to explore the trials and tribulations they face in maintaining law and order, and also delves into their lives and personal relationships. Mata Mata is inspired by true events and its historical references will enlighten younger Singaporeans and resonate with pioneers who lived through that exciting era.
