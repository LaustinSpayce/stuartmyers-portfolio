As part of my studies at [General Assembly](http://www.generalassemb.ly) in Singapore, our first portfolio project was to create a game that can be played entirely in the browser, using javascript.

Presenting the [Keyboard Warriors RPG.](https://laustinspayce.github.io/game-project-1/)

### Gameplay

After selecting a character class, a 1, 2 or 3 word phrase will appear.

Type the phrase in to score a point. Make a mistake or typo to lose a life.

If you make consecutive mistakes without a correct character being typed in, you won't lose more than 1 life.

### Features

- Simple player "classes" (difficulty):
  - Point 'n' Click Adventurer (easy 1 short word)
  - Keyboard Warrior (medium 2 medium words)
  - Netcodemancer (hard 3 any words)
- Each successful phrase completed is an "attack".
- Levels to go through:
  - Grassy Field
  - Dusty Desert
  - Creepy Caves
- Some light RPG-style levelling up and damage progression.
- Special boss attacks/features for the three bosses.
- Simple animations
- A randomised group of enemies to attack
