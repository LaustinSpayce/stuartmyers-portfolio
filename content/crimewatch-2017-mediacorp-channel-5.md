> Crimewatch is a local docu-drama that showcases Policeâ€™s solved cases, appeals for public help for unsolved cases and provides bite-sized anti-crime advisories. For more information on crime prevention advice, please visit [www.ncpc.org.sg](http://www.ncpc.org.sg/)

I've had the pleasure on working on many episodes of Crimewatch during my time at Mediacorp.
