Stu's Trivia Night is a quiz-taking app meant to be taken by multiple people at the same time, ideally in a classroom setting. [Try it out!](https://project-2-quiz.herokuapp.com/)

Some features implemented include keeping track of each individual's score, being able to resume games-in-progress if the quiz taker navigates away from the page and having a leaderboard shown to each participant.
